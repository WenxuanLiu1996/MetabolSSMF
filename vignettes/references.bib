Limit analysis indicates, and numerical experiments confirm, that the Fukuyama-Sugeno index is sensitive to both high and low values of m and may be unreliable because of this. Of the indexes tested, the Xie-Beni index provided the best response over a wide range of choices for the number of clusters, (2-10), and for m from 1.01-7. Finally, our calculations suggest that the best choice for m is probably in the interval [1.5, 2.5], whose mean and midpoint, m=2, have often been the preferred choice for many users of {FCM}.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The study uses latent Dirichlet allocation and k-means clustering algorithm and applies them to a news data set used in previous similar studies. The aim of this paper is twofold: it first shows that normalizing the weights in the vector space, for the document-term matrix of the text documents, dramatically improves the quality of clusters and hence the accuracy of clustering when using k-means algorithm. The results are compared to a recent study on clustering Arabic text documents. Second, it shows that the combined method is superior in terms of clustering quality for Arabic text documents according to external measures, such as purity, F-measure, entropy, accuracy, and other measures. It is shown in this paper that the purity of the combined method is 0.933 compared to 0.82 for k-means algorithm, and these figures are higher in comparison to a recent similar study. This is also confirmed by the other used validation measures. The correctness of the combined method is then confirmed using different Arabic data sets.},

	abstract = {Clustering is an explorative data analysis technique used for investigating the underlying structure in the data. It described as the grouping of objects, where the objects share similar characteristics. Over the past 50 years, clustering has been widely applied to atmospheric science data in particular, climate and meteorological data. Since the 1980's, air pollution studies began employing clustering techniques, and has since been successful, and the aim of this paper is to provide a review of such studies. In particular, two well known and commonly used clustering methods i.e. k-means and hierarchical agglomerative, that have been applied in air pollution studies have been reviewed. Air pollution data from two sources i.e. ground-based monitoring stations and air mass trajectories depicting pollutant pathways, have been included. Research works that have focused on spatio-temporal characteristics of air pollutants, pollutant behavior in terms of source, transport pathways, apportionment and links to meteorological conditions, comprise much of the research works reviewed. A total of 100 research articles were included during the period of 1980–2019. The purpose of the clustering approach, the specific technique used and the data to which it was applied constitute much of the discussion presented in this review. Overall, the k-means technique has been extensively used among the studies, while average and Ward linkages were the most frequently applied hierarchical clustering techniques. Reviews of clustering techniques applied in air pollution studies are currently lacking and this paper aims to fill that gap. In addition, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review dedicated to clustering applications in air pollution studies, and the first that covers the longest time span (1980–2019).},

	abstract = {The amount of data in soil science increased at exponential rates over the last decades, promoted by rapid technological innovation. This development led to a better understanding of processes but also required the introduction of data mining into soil science. With diffuse reflectance Fourier transform ({DRIFT}) spectroscopy, one of those new methods, soil scientist could build up large spectral libraries. These libraries can expand over large, heterogeneous areas requiring classification algorithms to find subsets or patterns in the data prior to further analysis. The k-means algorithm has become one of the most frequently used algorithms for this task. However, fuzzy k-means ({FKM}) clustering, a fuzzy variation of k-means, is potentially better suited for spectral data. Fuzzy logic allows for class overlaps and is supposed to reflect the complex nature of soil spectra and continuous environmental variables. In this study, we collected over 1000 mid-infrared {DRIFT} spectra of agricultural soils from the West African savannah zone and clustered the data using k-means and {FKM}. Our aim was to explore the feasibility of centroid-based cluster algorithms in finding substructures in spectral data and to discuss the benefits of fuzzy clustering. We found a two-group pattern separating the data set in a northern and southern part. The clustering could primarily be explained by geology and climatic gradients. While both algorithms performed similarly well in picking up the structure, {FKM} could reveal a transition zone between the two clusters that was not detectable with k-means. This transition zone was explained by a gradual change in aeolian dust deposition, topography, and a change in geology. With this study, we showed the benefits of fuzzy clustering over traditional hard clustering for finding substructure in unexplored spectral data. We recommend the use of continuous classes, as they incorporate more information that could potentially improve subsequent analysis.},

	abstract = {Clustering is one of the most used tools in data analysis. In the last decades, due to the increasing complexity of data, soft clustering has received a great deal of attention. There exist different approaches that can be considered as soft. The most known is the fuzzy approach that consists in assigning objects to clusters with membership degrees, depending on the dissimilarities between each object and all the prototypes, ranging in the unit interval. Closely related to the fuzzy approach, there is the possibilistic one that, differently from the previous one, relaxes some constraints on the membership degrees. In particular, the objects are assigned to clusters with degrees of typicalities, depending just on the dissimilarities between each object and the closest prototype. A further soft approach is the rough one. In this case, there are not degrees ranging between 0 and 1 but objects with intermediate features belong to the boundary region and are assigned to more than one cluster. Even if it is not universally recognized in the scientific community as an approach of soft clustering, from our point of view, the model-based approach can also be considered as such. Model-based clustering methods also produce a soft partition of the objects and the posterior probability of a component membership may play a role similar to the membership degree. The four approaches are critically described from a theoretical point of view and an empirical comparative analysis is carried out.

Fuzzy set theory provides such an approach that quantitatively assigns individuals to geographically and taxonomically continuous classes. We hypothesized that the fuzzy-c-means algorithm, based on a fuzzy objective function, could be used to quantify pedons into intragrade and extragrade classes and that minimization of the function would allow for the most “precise” classification, which could be validated by mathematically heuristic methods. These methods assume that local extreme (or abrupt changes) in the value of the objective function or its derivatives indicate optimal grouping. This approach was applied on two transects traversing a subcatchment in the central Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia. The resulting fuzzy soil classes were found to have reasonable spatial continuity and contiguity, which were associated with local variation in slope features and parent material. Thus the approach identified plausible groupings (substructures) among the soil individuals that realistically reflected changes in the external factors (principally landform and lithology) controlling the processes generating the substructures. The structure-factor relationships could be used for further rapid soil pattern recognition embodied in soil classification and mapping.},

The presentation and underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is complex and heterogeneous. Recent studies attempted to stratify T2D into distinct subgroups using data-driven approaches, but their clinical utility may be limited if categorical representations of complex phenotypes are suboptimal. We apply a soft-clustering (archetype) method to characterize newly diagnosed T2D based on 32 clinical variables. We assign quantitative clustering scores for individuals and investigate the associations with glycemic deterioration, genetic risk scores, circulating omics biomarkers, and phenotypic stability over 36 months. Four archetype profiles represent dysfunction patterns across combinations of T2D etiological processes and correlate with multiple circulating biomarkers. One archetype associated with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and impaired β cell glucose sensitivity corresponds with the fastest disease progression and highest demand for anti-diabetic treatment. We demonstrate that clinical heterogeneity in T2D can be mapped to heterogeneity in individual etiological processes, providing a potential route to personalized treatments.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland help regulation of the body's metabolism. A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature for thyroid disease classification. As far as we know, clustering techniques have not been used in thyroid diseases data set so far. This paper proposes a comparison between hard and fuzzy clustering algorithms for thyroid diseases data set in order to find the optimal number of clusters. Different scalar validity measures are used in comparing the performances of the proposed clustering systems. To demonstrate the performance of each algorithm, the feature values that represent thyroid disease are used as input for the system. Several runs are carried out and recorded with a different number of clusters being specified for each run (between 2 and 11), so as to establish the optimum number of clusters. To find the optimal number of clusters, the so-called elbow criterion is applied. The experimental results revealed that for all algorithms, the elbow was located at c=3. The clustering results for all algorithms are then visualized by the Sammon mapping method to find a low-dimensional (normally 2D or 3D) representation of a set of points distributed in a high dimensional pattern space. At the end of this study, some recommendations are formulated to improve determining the actual number of clusters present in the data set.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients are admitted to the hospital for respiratory illness at different stages of their disease course. It is important to appropriately analyse this heterogeneity in surveillance data to accurately measure disease severity among those hospitalized. The purpose of this study was to determine if unique baseline clusters of influenza patients exist and to examine the association between cluster membership and in‐hospital outcomes.

Methods
Patients hospitalized with influenza at two hospitals in Southeast Michigan during the 2017/2018 (n = 242) and 2018/2019 (n = 115) influenza seasons were included. Physiologic and laboratory variables were collected for the first 24 h of the hospital stay. K‐medoids clustering was used to determine groups of individuals based on these values. Multivariable linear regression or Firth's logistic regression were used to examine the association between cluster membership and clinical outcomes.

Results
Three clusters were selected for 2017/2018, mainly differentiated by blood glucose level. After adjustment, those in C171 had 5.6 times the odds of mechanical ventilator use than those in C172 (95\% {CI}: 1.49, 21.1) and a significantly longer mean hospital length of stay than those in both C172 (mean 1.5 days longer, 95\% {CI}: 0.2, 2.7) and C173 (mean 1.4 days longer, 95\% {CI}: 0.3, 2.5). Similar results were seen between the two clusters selected for 2018/2019.

Conclusion
In this study of hospitalized influenza patients, we show that distinct clusters with higher disease acuity can be identified and could be targeted for evaluations of vaccine and influenza antiviral effectiveness against disease attenuation. The association of higher disease acuity with glucose level merits evaluation.},

So, in this paper the two most popular clustering algorithms K-Means and K-Medoids are evaluated on dataset transaction10k of {KEEL}. The input to these algorithms are randomly distributed data points and based on their similarity clusters has been generated. The comparison results show that time taken in cluster head selection and space complexity of overlapping of cluster is much better in K-Medoids than K-Means. Also K-Medoids is better in terms of execution time, non sensitive to outliers and reduces noise as compared to K-Means as it minimizes the sum of dissimilarities of data objects.},

	abstract = {Soil provides ecosystem services, supports human health and habitation, stores carbon and regulates emissions of greenhouse gases. Unprecedented pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening agro-ecological balances and food security. It is important that we learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil visible–near infrared (vis–{NIR}) spectral library. It is currently the largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as soil organic and inorganic carbon, clay, silt, sand and iron contents, cation exchange capacity, and {pH}. Using wavelets to treat the spectra, which were recorded in different laboratories using different spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a machine learning algorithm can find the local relationships in the data to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of.},

In probabilistic models, the core idea is to model the data from a generative process. Generative models are among the most fundamental of all clustering methods, because they try to understand the underlying process through which a cluster is generated. Density- and grid-based methods are two closely related classes, which try to explore the data space at high levels of granularity. The streaming scenario is particularly challenging for clustering algorithms due to the requirements of real-time analysis, and the evolution and concept-drift in the underlying data. While streaming algorithms work under the assumption that the data are too large to be stored explicitly, the big data framework leverages advances in storage technology in order to actually store the data and process them.},

In fuzzy clustering, in addition to the correctness of the clusters assigned to each node, the produced membership of one node to each cluster is also important. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) method. Despite the well-known fuzzy clustering techniques like {FCM}, the proposed method does not depend on any parameter. Also, it can produce appropriate memberships based on the network structure and so identify the overlap nodes from non-overlap nodes, well. Also, to evaluate the validity of such fuzzy clustering algorithms, we propose two new evaluation criteria ({SFEC} and {UFEC}), which are constructed based on the neighborhood structure of nodes and can evaluate the memberships. Experimental results on some real-world networks and also many artificial networks show the effectiveness and reliability of our proposed criteria.},

Researchers may be interested in clustering the observations, the variables, or both. If the data is non-negative, then Non-negative Matrix Factorization ({NMF}) can be used to perform the clustering. By its nature, {NMF}-based clustering is focused on the large values. If the data is normalized by subtracting the row/column means, it becomes of mixed signs and the original {NMF} cannot be used. Our idea is to split and then concatenate the positive and negative parts of the matrix, after taking the absolute value of the negative elements. {NMF} applied to the concatenated data, which we call {PosNegNMF}, offers the advantages of the original {NMF} approach, while giving equal weight to large and small values. We use two public health datasets to illustrate the new method and compare it with alternative clustering methods, such as K-means and clustering methods based on the Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}) or Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}). With the exception of situations where a reasonably accurate factorization can be achieved using the first {SVD} component, we recommend that the epidemiologists and environmental scientists use the new method to obtain clusters with improved quality and interpretability.},

We only require to have \$d\$ points on each facet of the convex hull of the basis vectors whose dimension is \$d-1\$.

In this paper, we study the properties of semi-{NMF} from which we develop exact and heuristic algorithms. Our contribution is threefold. First, we prove that the error of a semi-{NMF} of rank \$r\$ has to be smaller than the best unconstrained approximation of rank \$r-1\$. This leads us to a new initialization procedure based on the singular value decomposition ({SVD}) with a guarantee on the quality of the approximation. Second, we propose an exact algorithm (that is, an algorithm that finds an optimal solution), also based on the {SVD}, for a certain class of matrices (including nonnegative irreducible matrices) from which we derive an initialization for matrices not belonging to that class. Numerical experiments illustrate that this second approach performs extremely well, and allows us to compute optimal semi-{NMF} decompositions in many situations. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of semi-{NMF} proving its {NP}-hardness, already in the rank-one case (that is, for \$r = 1\$), and we show that semi-{NMF} is sometimes ill-posed (that is, an optimal solution does not exist).},

Since the {FCM} memberships do not always explain the degrees of belonging for the data well, Krishnapuram and Keller proposed a possibilistic approach to clustering to correct this weakness of {FCM}. However, the performance of Krishnapuram and Keller's approach depends heavily on the parameters. In this paper, we propose another possibilistic clustering algorithm ({PCA}) which is based on the {FCM} objective function, the partition coefficient ({PC}) and partition entropy ({PE}) validity indexes. The resulting membership becomes the exponential function, so that it is robust to noise and outliers. The parameters in {PCA} can be easily handled. Also, the {PCA} objective function can be considered as a potential function, or a mountain function, so that the prototypes of {PCA} can be correspondent to the peaks of the estimated function. To validate the clustering results obtained through a {PCA}, we generalized the validity indexes of {FCM}. This generalization makes each validity index workable in both fuzzy and possibilistic clustering models. By combining these generalized validity indexes, an unsupervised possibilistic clustering is proposed. Some numerical examples and real data implementation on the basis of the proposed {PCA} and generalized validity indexes show their effectiveness and accuracy.},

This function depends on the data set, geometric distance measure, distance between cluster centroids and more importantly on the fuzzy partition generated by any fuzzy algorithm used. The function is mathematically justified via its relationship to a well-defined hard clustering validity function, the separation index for which the condition of uniqueness has already been established. The performance of this validity function compares favorably to that of several others. The application of this validity function to color image segmentation in a computer color vision system for recognition of {IC} wafer defects which are otherwise impossible to detect using gray-scale image processing is discussed.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

However, the problem is to understand what knowledge means, to find ways of representing knowledge, and to specify automated machineries that can extract useful information from stored knowledge. Knowledge is something people have in their mind, and which they can express through natural language. Knowl edge is acquired not only from books, but also from observations made during experiments; in other words, from data. Changing data into knowledge is not a straightforward task. A set of data is generally disorganized, contains useless details, although it can be incomplete. Knowledge is just the opposite: organized (e.g. laying bare dependencies, or classifications), but expressed by means of a poorer language, i.e. pervaded by imprecision or even vagueness, and assuming a level of granularity. One may say that knowledge is summarized and organized data - at least the kind of knowledge that computers can store.},

Raman spectroscopy is an attractive technique for identifying disease related molecular changes due to its simplicity. Here, we describe a fibre optic fluid cell for undertaking spontaneous Raman spectroscopy studies of human biofluids that is suitable for use away from a standard laboratory setting. Using this system, we examined serum obtained from patients with {ALS} at their first presentation to our centre (n = 66) and 4 months later (n = 27). We analysed Raman spectra using bounded simplex-structured matrix factorization ({BSSMF}), a generalisation of non-negative matrix factorisation which uses the distribution of the original data to limit the factorisation modes (spectral patterns). Biomarkers associated with {ALS} disease such as measures of symptom severity, respiratory function and inflammatory/immune pathways (C3/C-reactive protein) correlated with baseline Raman modes. Between visit spectral changes were highly significant (p = 0.0002) and were related to protein structure. Comparison of Raman data with established {ALS} biomarkers as a trial outcome measure demonstrated a reduction in required sample size with {BSSMF} Raman. Our portable, simple to use fibre optic system allied to {BSSMF} shows promise in the quantification of disease-related changes in {ALS} over short timescales.},

Previously, these methods have not been combined. In this work, I explore a hierarchical generative probabilistic model that incorporates both n-gram statistics and latent topic variables by extending a unigram topic model to include properties of a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model. The model hyperparameters are inferred using a Gibbs {EM} algorithm. On two data sets, each of 150 documents, the new model exhibits better predictive accuracy than either a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model or a unigram topic model. Additionally, the inferred topics are less dominated by function words than are topics discovered using unigram statistics, potentially making them more meaningful.},

	rights = {Copyright 2022 by Catherine Gabriel Potts},
	url = {https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/16648},
	abstract = {Scientific imaging applications create large sets of high-dimensional data, which may be difficult to process using traditional supervised machine learning representative models. First, many representative models generate computational elements that are difficult to interpret in terms of the scientific application and second, the high embedding dimension of the images often makes generating the models computationally inefficient. We propose using archetypal analysis ({AA}) as the representative model for these scientific imaging problems, since the computational elements, so called archetypes, resemble members of the original dataset. Specifically, the archetypes are generated as extreme points to an approximation of the convex hull of the data cloud, which means they maintain the structure of individual data points. To improve the computational task of generating the {AA} model, we propose a sketch-based {AA} method which projects the data to a lower embedding dimension before calculating the computational elements, lowering computation time for these high-dimensional problems, while at the same time retaining the geometric structure enough so that the computational elements closely match the results of {AA}. We also applied a primal-dual hybrid gradient ({PDHG}) solver to the {AA} algorithm structure attempting to speed up computation. To verify the significance of the interpretation of {AA}, we applied {AA} to transient fluorescent calcium images, recorded in the Kunze Neuroengineering lab as videos, in order to determine whether or not adding different nanoparticles changed the way the neurons in culture communicate. We also applied our sketch-based {AA} method to other sorts of imaging data sets, exploring the differences between our method and the standard {AA} method. Our experimentation shows the different ways that {AA} can be adapted to scientific imaging applications, providing a machine learning representation model that is interpretable in the context of the imaging problem and verifies the benefits of the sketch-based method in terms of computation time.},

	abstract = {Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.
Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.
Besides the term clustering, there is a number of terms with similar meanings, including automatic classification, numerical taxonomy, botryology (from Greek βότρυς "grape"), typological analysis, and community detection. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.
Cluster analysis was originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Joseph Zubin in 1938 and Robert Tryon in 1939 and famously used by Cattell beginning in 1943 for trait theory classification in personality psychology.},

	abstract = {During the past decade metabolomics has emerged as one of the fastest developing branches of “-omics” technologies. Metabolomics involves documentation, identification, and quantification of metabolites through modern analytical platforms in various biological systems. Advanced analytical tools, such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}), liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy ({LC}/{MS}), and non-destructive nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy, have facilitated metabolite profiling of complex biological matrices. Metabolomics, along with transcriptomics, has an influential role in discovering connections between genetic regulation, metabolite phenotyping and biomarkers identification. Comprehensive metabolite profiling allows integration of the summarized data towards manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, determination of nutritional quality markers, improvement in crop yield, selection of desired metabolites/genes, and their heritability in modern breeding. Along with that, metabolomics is invaluable in predicting the biological activity of medicinal plants, assisting the bioactivity-guided fractionation process and bioactive leads discovery, as well as serving as a tool for quality control and authentication of commercial plant-derived natural products. Metabolomic analysis of human biofluids is implemented in clinical practice to discriminate between physiological and pathological state in humans, to aid early disease biomarker discovery and predict individual response to drug therapy. Thus, metabolomics could be utilized to preserve human health by improving the nutritional quality of crops and accelerating plant-derived bioactive leads discovery through disease diagnostics, or through increasing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs via more personalized approach. Here, we attempt to explore the potential value of metabolite profiling comprising the above-mentioned applications of metabolomics in crop improvement, medicinal plants utilization, and, in the prognosis, diagnosis and management of complex diseases.},

The key purpose of metabolomics is to identify the metabolites corresponding to each biological phenotype, and then provide an analysis of the mechanisms involved. Although metabolomics is important to understand the involved biological phenomena, the approach’s ability to obtain an exhaustive description of the processes is limited. Thus, an analysis-integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics approach is recommended. Such integration of different omics data requires specialized statistical and bioinformatics software. This review focuses on the steps involved in metabolomics research and summarizes several main tools for metabolomics analyses. We also outline the most abnormal metabolic pathways in several cancers and diseases, and discuss the importance of multi-omics integration algorithms. Overall, our goal is to summarize the current metabolomics analysis workflow and its main analysis software to provide useful insights for researchers to establish a preferable pipeline of metabolomics or multi-omics analysis.},

Continued development of bioinformatics and analytical strategies will accelerate widespread use and integration of metabolomics into systems biology.

However, a substantial proportion of hypercholesterolemic subjects do not have any mutations in these canonical genes, leaving the underlying pathobiology to be determined. In this study, we investigated to determine whether combining plasma metabolomics with genetic information increases insight in the biology of hypercholesterolemia. For this proof of concept study, we combined plasma metabolites from 119 hypercholesterolemic females with genetic information on the {LDL} canonical genes. Using hierarchical clustering, we identified four subtypes of hypercholesterolemia, which could be distinguished along two axes represented by triglyceride and large {LDL} particle concentration. Subjects with mutations in \textit{{LDLR}} or \textit{{APOB}} preferentially clustered together, suggesting that patients with defects in the {LDLR} pathway show a distinctive metabolomics profile.

The application of machine learning ({ML}) to analyze data, recognize patterns, and build models is expanding across multiple fields. In the same way, {ML} methods are utilized for the classification, regression, or clustering of highly complex metabolomic data.

Multivariate outliers can severely distort the estimation of population parameters. Detecting multivariate outliers is mainly disregarded or done by using the basic Mahalanobis distance. However, that indicator uses the multivariate sample mean and covariance matrix that are particularly sensitive to outliers. Hence, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of the basic Mahalanobis distance and argue instead in favor of a robust Mahalanobis distance. In particular, we present a variant based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant, a more robust procedure that is easy to implement. Using Monte Carlo simulations of bivariate sample distributions varying in size (ns=20, 100, 500) and population correlation coefficient (ρ=.10, .30, .50), we demonstrate the detrimental impact of outliers on parameter estimation and show the superiority of the {MCD} over the Mahalanobis distance. We also make recommendations for deciding whether to include vs. exclude outliers. Finally, we provide the procedures for calculating this indicator in R and {SPSS} software.},

In this study, {FCM} clustering is applied to cluster metabolomics data. {FCM} is performed directly on the data matrix to generate a membership matrix which represents the degree of association the samples have with each cluster. The method is parametrized with the number of clusters (C) and the fuzziness coefficient (m), which denotes the degree of fuzziness in the algorithm. Both have been optimized by combining {FCM} with partial least-squares ({PLS}) using the membership matrix as the Y matrix in the {PLS} model. The quality parameters R2Y and Q2 of the {PLS} model have been used to monitor and optimize C and m. Data of metabolic profiles from three gene types of Escherichia coli were used to demonstrate the method above. Different multivariable analysis methods have been compared. Principal component analysis failed to model the metabolite data, while partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded results with overfitting. On the basis of the optimized parameters, the {FCM} was able to reveal main phenotype changes and individual characters of three gene types of E. coli.

Better alternatives have been known in literature for a long time, and we want to draw attention to some of these easy to use options, that often perform better. This letter is a call to stop using the elbow method altogether, because it severely lacks theoretic support, and we want to encourage educators to discuss the problems of the method -- if introducing it in class at all -- and teach alternatives instead, while researchers and reviewers should reject conclusions drawn from the elbow method.},

	abstract = {Several research fields frequently deal with the analysis of diverse classification results of the same entities. This should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed clusters. The congruence between classifications can be quantified by clustering agreement measures, including pairwise agreement measures. Several measures have been proposed and the importance of obtaining confidence intervals for the point estimate in the comparison of these measures has been highlighted. A broad range of methods can be used for the estimation of confidence intervals. However, evidence is lacking about what are the appropriate methods for the calculation of confidence intervals for most clustering agreement measures. Here we evaluate the resampling techniques of bootstrap and jackknife for the calculation of the confidence intervals for clustering agreement measures. Contrary to what has been shown for some statistics, simulations showed that the jackknife performs better than the bootstrap at accurately estimating confidence intervals for pairwise agreement measures, especially when the agreement between partitions is low. The coverage of the jackknife confidence interval is robust to changes in cluster number and cluster size distribution.},

In particular, allele frequency estimation can be carried out with a Dirichlet prior. If data from several distinct populations are available, then the parameters characterizing the Dirichlet prior can be estimated by maximum likelihood and then used for allele frequency estimation in each of the separate populations. This empirical Bayes procedure tends to moderate extreme multinomial estimates based on sample proportions. The Dirichlet distribution can also be employed to model the contributions from different ancestral populations in computing forensic match probabilities. If the ancestral populations are in genetic equilibrium, then the product rule for computing match probabilities is valid conditional on the ancestral contributions to a typical person of the reference population. This fact facilitates computation of match probabilities and tight upper bounds to match probabilities.},

Making use of numerous samples drawn from the initial observations, these techniques require fewer assumptions and offer greater accuracy and insight than do standard methods in many problems. After presenting the underlying concepts, this introduction focuses on applications in regression analysis. These applications contrast two forms of bootstrap resampling in regression, illustrating their differences in a series of examples that include outliers and heteroscedasticity. Other regression examples use the bootstrap to estimate standard errors of robust estimators in regression and indirect effects in path models. Numerous variations of bootstrap confidence intervals exist, and examples stress the concepts that are common to the various approaches. Suggestions for computing bootstrap estimates appear throughout the discussion, and a section on computing suggests several broad guidelines.},

	abstract = {Agreement indices are commonly used to summarize the performance of both classification and clustering methods. The easy interpretation/intuition and desirable properties that result from the Rand and adjusted Rand indices, has led to their popularity over other available indices. While more algorithmic clustering approaches like k-means and hierarchical clustering produce hard partition assignments (assigning observations to a single cluster), other techniques like model-based clustering include information about the certainty of allocation of objects through class membership probabilities (soft partitions). To assess performance using traditional indices, e.g., the adjusted Rand index ({ARI}), the soft partition is mapped to a hard set of assignments, which commonly overstates the certainty of correct assignments. This paper proposes an extension of the {ARI}, the soft adjusted Rand index ({sARI}), with similar intuition and interpretation but also incorporating information from one or two soft partitions. It can be used in conjunction with the {ARI}, comparing the similarities of hard to soft, or soft to soft partitions to the similarities of the mapped hard partitions. Simulation study results support the intuition that in general, mapping to hard partitions tends to increase the measure of similarity between partitions. In applications, the {sARI} more accurately reflects the cluster boundary overlap commonly seen in real data.},
